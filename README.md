# SanrioWebsite
This is a website I made based on Sanrio (Hello Kitty and Friends) characters for my final project for Web Design 1 (CIS 1400) at OCC. 

I used HTML, CSS, Javscript, and Bootstrap to create this website on Adobe Dreamweaver. I also used Adobe Photoshop to create banners, images, buttons etc.
